# Introduction
Here we train agents to play the game 2048 using reinforcement learning, thanks to the Tensorforce library.

See the [main training notebook](https://github.com/Valentin-Laurent/Year-2048/blob/master/notebooks/Training_notebook.ipynb) for a nice overview of our work. You can also watch [this 8 minutes video](https://youtu.be/MuwEa2A6XLA?t=1423) for an introduction to RL and an analysis of our results (in french).

The code has been pushed during an intense 2 weeks-long project, and thus this repo could use some cleaning (I've started working on it) :)

# Install
Clone the project and install it (you may want to create a virtualenv first)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{group}/evaluating-student-writing.git
cd evaluating-student-writing
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install . -U
```
