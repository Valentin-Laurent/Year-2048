# Introduction
Here we train agents to play the game 2048 using reinforcement learning, thanks to the Tensorforce library. The code has been pushed during an intense 2 weeks-long project, so this repo could use some cleaning (I've started working on it) :)

See the [main training notebook](https://github.com/Valentin-Laurent/Year-2048/blob/master/notebooks/Training_notebook.ipynb) for a nice overview of our work. You can also watch the demo of our project in [this video](https://youtu.be/MuwEa2A6XLA?t=1423), where I give an introduction to RL and an analysis of our results (8 minutes, in french).

# Set up
Clone this repository and install the package in development mode (you may want to create a virtualenv first):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Valentin-Laurent/Year-2048.git
cd Year-2048
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
